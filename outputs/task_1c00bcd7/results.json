In some cases, it can exceed or augment human capabilities by providing better or faster ways to diagnose, treat, or prevent disease.[1][2][3] As the widespread use of AI in healthcare is still relatively new, research is ongoing into its applications across various medical subdisciplines and related industries. AI programs are being applied to practices such as diagnostics,[4] treatment protocol development,[5] drug development,[6] personalized medicine,[7] and patient monitoring and care.[8] Since radiographs are the most commonly performed imaging tests in radiology, the potential for AI to assist with triage and interpretation of radiographs is particularly significant.[9] Using AI also presents unprecedented ethical concerns related to issues such as data privacy, automation of jobs, and amplifying already existing b",
